title: Bootcamp - One Month To Go

<article class="home-article">
<h1>One Month To Go</h1>

<p>I am officially two-thirds through the <a href="https://awesomeincu.com/bootcamp">
Awesome Inc U Web Development Bootcamp!</a></p>

<p>Looking back over the last two months feels comparable to a long-distance trip
on a train - the scenery has changed a lot, with more interesting sights
around every bend. In recent weeks, we've been in REST API land, using 
<a href="http://www.django-rest-framework.org">Django REST Framework</a> 
to build our own API backend, and 
<a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> to build client UIs.</p>

<p>It's an understatement to say that we've covered a lot of material.
I started bootcamp with 4 <a href="https://github.com/bFraley?tab=repositories">repositories </a> on Github. Two months later I have nearly 50!
Some are one-offs I cranked out in an afternoon. Others are full
blown <a href="https://twapp-brett.herokuapp.com">dynamic web applications</a> built according to MVP (minimum viable product) client requirements.</p>

<p>With one month left, every day counts! I have important studying, portfolio polishing,
and a final individual project to complete. Throughout the next month, with every new LOC, every error message to overcome, and a healthy supply of to do list items getting added to the pile, I keep reminding myself to have fun.</p>

<p>The time has come to land my first role employed as a web developer! I am extremely
excited about the future, and forever grateful to Awesome Inc, our instructors, and each and every student who is a part of our bootcamp experience.</p>
