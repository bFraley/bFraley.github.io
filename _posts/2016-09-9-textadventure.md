title: Text Adventures in Python

<h1>Text Adventures in Python</h1>

<p>Over the last week at bootcamp, we have dived deep into OOP in Python.
The mission, design and create a text-based adventure. After considering many
game concepts, my game theme was chosen and some basic planning began.</p>

<p>The most important lesson I have learned about the object oriented approach to programming
anything is that planning, organization, and prioritizing small tasks are critical steps.
While project planning and management are key steps to designing and building anything,
I realized that planning is a skill. Like all skills, they take regular practice to improve upon.</p>

<p>In the past, the extent of project planning I've done on my own small projects has
been rather limited. I am in the habit of putting a lot of implementation notes in a README document -
and calling it good. Planning should be a simple process that uses simple tools, but one document and
perhaps a Wiki may not be the best place to isolate small tasks and goals.</p>

<p>From now on, I'll be using a small set of dedicated tools for organization and planning.
I will keep the content of README and Wiki documents aimed toward users, while using Github issues
for specific implementation tasks and project milestones.</p>

<p>With planning and project setup complete, on to thoughts on object oriented programming.
I decided make a ninja game. The requirements were to have a character who could move through
rooms or stages, battle enemies or complete some task, and have some notion
of an inventory.</p>

<p>I limited the game environment to a 3 x 3 grid representing city blocks. Implementing the movement
of the ninja from one block to the next was a rewarding experience. Especially, figuring out the logic
to give the city (a Python list of 8 objects) boundaries that the player cannot move past. I am going to
write a little about the classes and methods I used, but then the rest of this post will detail the simple
way to define edges of a square grid, or matrix.</p>

<h2>I am an object, what do I need to know about, or do?</h2>

<p>I learned (above) is a very helpful approach to designing a Class and it's corresponding methods.</p>
