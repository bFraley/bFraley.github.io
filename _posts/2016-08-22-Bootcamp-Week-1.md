title: Bootcamp - Week 1

<article>
<h1>bootCamp(week1).start()</h1>

<p>This week I've been more actively engaged in learning new concepts and technologies than I ever have before. While fellow cohorts and I come from diverse education and career backgrounds, I feel we've worked well together through an impressive set of challenges and fundamental groundwork in only three days time. I can't imagine attempting to complete the same amount of dedicated study in only a few days on my own. The most rewarding aspect of my first week at A Inc U's bootcamp has been learning in a group environment.</p>

<p>What I'm enjoying most, is completing morning programming challenges. Especially, discussing different approaches to solutions with my peers. One could discuss solutions to problems on web forums all day long, but talking through an algorithm together in person, and sharing code with each other, has helped me to firmly understand new problem solving skills.</p>

<p>In years prior, I dabbled with quite a few programming languages and web technologies. I am already rather familiar with the likes of many concepts and tools commonly used in crafting and maintaining software. But, I have found myself quite challenged when diving into unfamiliar territory. So, during this first week I've identified that my overall cognitive focus, as I move through the program each day, is to improve the speed and accuracy that I'm able to follow directions, listen to others, and perceive new unfamiliar material.</p>

<p>My first week at Awesome Inc has been nothing less than the personal equivalent to a major shifting of the Earth's poles!</p>
