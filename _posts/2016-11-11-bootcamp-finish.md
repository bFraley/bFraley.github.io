    <h1>Bootcamp Finish Line</h1>

    <div class="well">
        <p>Our last official day of <a href="https://awesomeincu.com/bootcamp">bootcamp at Awesome Inc.
        concluded on November 11th. You might think we partied, hung out all day playing video games
        or rounds of ping pong, just taking it easy. We were much more productive and pragmatic than
        that!</p>

        <p>We discussed the many resources for finding and applying to potential employers,
        more subjects to study and practice to keep our skills sharp. We spent time reflecting
        on our overall experience and offering feedback that will help Awesome Inc on their 
        next boot camp cohort. This was in our bit of extra time left in the day. That morning,
        and early afternoon, Nick Such covered Android Studio for building native Java mobile
        applications, as well as built up a sample IOS application in Swift. It was actually 
        pretty cool having that one last lesson up at 'Fort Awesome'!</p>

        <p>For me, it was the probably the hardest challenge I've ever faced. So, I'm
        absolutely ecstatic that I completed it. I already had a few years of experience
        dabbling with many programming languages and web technologies before I signed up
        to boot camp. It was an ideal opportunity for me to get serious about a career in
        software. Since 2012, I've dedicated many late nights - after 12 hour shifts at the factory,
        to reading and writing code, without being paid a dime. I've done that because I knew that
        eventually I could earn a living doing what I enjoy doing.</p>

        <p>It's not that I'm in love with semi-colons, black backgrounds with neon green text,
        or the movie Hackers, it's that no matter who you are and where you live, software, 
        engineering, and pure innovation can and will be a part of your life. I learned this 
        at a rather young age, and always knew the key to innovation in my generation would
        be the integrations of computers and software with every facet of our modern world.
        I knew this before the Web, when my older brother was showing me how to use Telnet
        to connect to a BBS. Even when playing Oregon Trail in 1st grade (on a Macintosh) I
        remember thinking "Isn't weird how far people have come since heading west? We
        have a computer, why are we playing wagon games with it?"</p>

        <p>I'm bringing up my childhood and the years I've been trying to teach myself 
        programming, writing my own little projects, because I have finally come full
        circle with those childhood interests. The boot camp experience has given me
        something more than web development training. It's given me the confidence to
        break down goals into manageable tasks so that I can actually accomplish them.
        I remember building robots as a kid (out of cardboard), and I've always wanted
        to build robots as an adult, real robots programmed in C! Now, in my spare time,
        I feel I could tackle a complex robot project with confidence. My point is, I
        feel that my experience at boot camp is only the beginning of many amazing years
        in a career creating and developing amazing technologies.</p>
