<h1>120 Hours</h1>

<p>I turn 33 years old in one week. My son just turned 6 earlier this week, on August 31st.
With decades apart in age, we both are going through a tremendous phase of learning and 
personal development.</p>

<p>He began life as big 1st grader 3 weeks ago. I just wrapped up my first
two weeks of web development bootcamp. After many prior attempts, on this Memorial Day weekend,
he is now riding his bicycle without training wheels! I feel I've found a similar balance as
a father, and as a developer.</p>
