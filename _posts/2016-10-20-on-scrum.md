        <p>I had heard of Agile and read about writing task-based stories and
        the concept of 'sprints' in software development, but after attending
        a presentation on SCRUM by Bill Bruce (scrum master at Lexmark), I
        have a new understanding of how SCRUM is implemented and used effectively
        by development teams.</p>

        <p>I have a lot of experience in manufacturing. I've been a member of teams 
        at manufacturing plants where we used most of the popular process management 
        and improvement systems - in some form. Particularly, 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen">Kaizen</a> and 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban">Kanban</a>.</p>

        <p>The term 'backlog', to me, meant a daily printout of customer part orders that
        are due to ship out that day or week. My backlog usually became greasy and ripped, 
        coffee-stained, and covered in highlighter and sharpie marker! My retrospective 
        consisted of drawing a large X across my paperwork, tearing it all in half and tossing
        it in the trash. Then I'd go print my next one.</p>

        <p>So, I was initially surprised that the backlog made it's way into SCRUM / Agile practices.
        After learning more about SCRUM, I realized a few areas where the
        software industry is really doing things the 'right' way compared to some
        of the 'fly by the seat of your pants' processes I've experienced in extremely
        fast factory production environments. Here's where scrum masters and development
        teams exceed the process flow and documentation usually seen on the factory floor:</p>

        <h3>Less is More</h3>
        
        <p>Software teams are encouraged to only commit to reasonable
        amounts of work that they know they have a solid chance of completing.
        This allows scrum masters, product owners, and the entire organization 
        to improve predictability for procuring and shipping their product or 
        service. This way of thinking (less production) is an utterly ridiculous
        none starter in the factory world. But, these factories are consistently
        late, sometimes by weeks or months! This is where SCRUM really proves 
        it's effectiveness for planning and workload expectations.</p>

        <h3>Friction</h3>

        <p>Yes, I literally mean the physical force, 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction">friction,</a> and it's properties.</p>

        <p>Depending on the area or problem-domain, in software development the only
        amount of real friction that may exist is the friction causing heat in the
        circuits of our machines. This is the beauty of software itself, being able to virtualize
        more and more of the hard inefficiencies of our physical world. This removes
        numerous obstacles that, in most industries other than software, 
        reduce the ability to produce and ship products and services on time.</p>

        <p>The problem a scrum master would face in a factory is that it's hard to predict when a
        bolt will break, a robot motor will burn out, an employee gets injured 
        (shutting down production), or a forklift hydraulic hose will burst!</p>

        <p>In software, there's a different set of unpredictable problems that could deter production,
        but none of them weigh 100s of tons, or are located in life threatening hazardous
        conditions. This gives Agile / SCRUM software teams a major leg up for predictably delivering what they commit to accomplish. I am now highly interested in the SCRUM approach to Agile development, and am looking forward to practicing it's methods in
        my work, and even personal life.</p>
