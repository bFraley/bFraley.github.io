title: Weekly List - Fall 2016

<article>
<h1>Every week, this fall...</h1>    

<p>There's numerious (practically endless) educational materials and opportunities to learn the next
big thing in software, or just about anything else one may want to learn. I've narrowed down
some of the best resources I've found that I'll dedicating some time to each week - at least
for the next month. Here's my plan. I'm writing about it in order to really solidify my 
dedication to using these resources each week!</p>

<ul>
    <li>Hacker Rank (Interview challenges) (3 general challenges a week)</li>
    <li>Eggly (1-2 courses week)</li>
    <li>Interview Cake (1 tutorial course per week)</li>
    <li>1 open source issue per week</li>
</ul>
