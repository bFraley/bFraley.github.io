title: Weekly List - Fall 2016
---

<article class="home-article">
<h1>Every week, this fall...</h1>    

<p>There's numerous materials online to learn the next
big thing in software development. I've narrowed down
some of the best resources that I'll be dedicating some time to each week - at least for the next month. Here's the plan:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="egghead.io">egghead.io </a>(1-2 courses per week)</li>
    <li><a href="https://hackerrank.com">Hacker Rank </a>
    (3 Interview challenges, 3 general challenges per week).</li>
    <li><a href="https://interviewcake.com">Interview Cake </a>(Study 3 challenge questions per week).</li>
    <li>Research 1 open source issue (bug) per week, and attempt a fix/pull request.</li>
</ul>
