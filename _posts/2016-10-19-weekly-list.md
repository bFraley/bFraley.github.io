<article class="home-article">
    <h1>Every week, this fall...</h1>

    <div class="well">  

        <p>There's numerous materials online to learn the next
        big thing in software development. I've narrowed down
        some of the best resources that I'll be dedicating some
        time to each week - at least for the next month.</p> 

        <h4>Here's the plan:</h4>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="egghead.io">egghead.io </a>(1-2 courses per week)</li>
            <li><a href="https://hackerrank.com">Hacker Rank </a>
            (3 Interview challenges, 3 general challenges per week).</li>
            <li><a href="https://interviewcake.com">Interview Cake </a>(Study 3 challenge questions per week).</li>
            <li>Research 1 open source issue (bug) per week, and attempt a fix/pull request.</li>
        </ul>
