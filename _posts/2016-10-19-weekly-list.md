title: Weekly List - Fall 2016
---

<article class="home-article">
<h1>Every week, this fall...</h1>    

<p>There's numerious (practically endless) educational materials online to learn the next
big thing in software development. I've narrowed down
some of the best resources I've found that I'll be dedicating some time to each week - at least
for the next month. Here's my plan. I'm writing about it in order to really solidify my 
dedication to using these resources each week!</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="egghead.io">Eggly </a>(1-2 courses week)</li>
    <li><a href="https://hackerrank.com">Hacker Rank </a>
    (3 Interview challenges, 3 general challenges a week).</li>
    <li><a href="https://interviewcake.com">Interview Cake </a>(Study 3 challenge questions per week).</li>
    <li>Research 1 open source issue (bug) per week, and attempt a fix/pull request.</li>
</ul>
