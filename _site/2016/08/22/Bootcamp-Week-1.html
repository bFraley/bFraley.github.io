<h1>bootCamp(week1).start()</h1>

<p>This week I've been more actively engaged in learning new concepts and technologies than I ever have before. Fellow 'bootcampers' and I come from diverse education and career backgrounds. Reflecting on the first week, I feel we've worked well together through an impressive set of challenges and fundamental groundwork. I can't imagine attempting to complete the same amount of dedicated study on my own. I've found that learning in a group environment is one of the best, most enjoyable ways to get better at any skill.</p>

<p>What I'm enjoying most, is completing morning programming challenges. Especially, discussing different approaches to solutions with my peers. Developers could discuss solutions to problems on web forums all day long, but talking through an algorithm together in person, while sharing code with each other, has helped me to firmly understand new problem solving skills.</p>

<p>In years prior, I dabbled with many programming languages and web technologies. I am rather familiar with the likes of many concepts and tools commonly used in crafting and maintaining software. But, I have found myself quite challenged when diving into unfamiliar territory. During this first week I've identified a need to improve my overall cognitive focus as I move through the program each day, and to improve the speed and accuracy that I'm able to perceive new unfamiliar material.</p>

<p>My first week at Awesome Inc has been nothing less than the personal equivalent to a major shifting of the Earth's poles!</p>
