<article>
    <p>I'm currently a student at Awesome Inc's bootcamp in Lexington, KY. I'm looking forward to
    solving technical problems professionally, where I'm part of a team - doing what I love.</p>

    <p>I also enjoy music and songwriting, building with my hands, gardening, and exploring new ideas
    in business and technology that make the world a better place.</p>
