title: Bootcamp - One Month To Go

<article>
<h1>One Month To Go</h1>

<p>I am officially two-thirds through Awesome Inc U Web Development Bootcamp!</p>

<p>Looking back over the last two months feels comparable to a long-distance trip
on a train - the scenery has changed a lot, with more interesting sights
around every bend. In recent weeks, we've been in REST API land, using Django 
REST Framework to build our own API backend, and AngularJS to build client UIs.</p>

<p>It's an understatement to say that we've covered a lot of material in two months.
I started bootcamp with 4 repositories on Github, and two months later I am near 50!
Some are one-offs I cranked out in an afternoon. Others are full
blown dynamic web applications built according to MVP client requirements.</p>

<p>With one month left, we all have important studying, portfolio polishing,
and a final individual project to build. Throughout the next month, with every new LOC, 
every error message to overcome, and with every to do list item getting added to the pile,
I keep reminding myself to have fun, and the time has come to land my first role
employed as a web developer!</p>
